# First draft

All instinct. Write from the heart and don't think about character, story structure or anything technical.

# Second draft

Think about plot

# Third draft

Realize that plot is hollow and the reason is that character is underdeveloped. This caused me to go back to draft 1 and try to understand what the actions demanded of the character.

In other words, I made choices in the first draft. Those choices were instinctive, and in that they were the best ones. But they didn't make any logical sense because they were motivated by my personal feelings and not by the feelings of the character executing them. This draft was all about developing the history and personality of the person taking the actions.

# Lessons

1. Characters are defined by the dramatic actions they take. Dramatic actions have consequences and a character acts to achieve or in spite of the consequences.
